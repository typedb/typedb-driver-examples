  to add a new query implementation:
    1. add the question and function to the approriate list of dictionaries:
      current lists are: get_query_examples, aggregate_query_examples and compute_query_examples
      example:
        get_query_examples = [
          ...
          {
            "question": "new question?"
            "query_function": execute_query_#
          }
        ]
    2. add the function and its implementation:
      use the template below
'''


## The template for execute_query functions
# def execute_query_format(question, transaction)

#   ## join the query list elements with a new line before printing
