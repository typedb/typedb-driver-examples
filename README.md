[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/graknlabs/examples/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/graknlabs/examples)

This repository includes examples that showcase usage of Grakn Clients in reading from and writing to a Grakn knowledge graph.

## Explore Client Examples

Grakn officially supports clients for Java, Node.js and Python. Learn more about [Grakn Clients](http://dev.grakn.ai/docs/client-api/overview).

### Client Java Examples
- [Phone Calls: Migrate and perform expressive queries using Client Java](phone_calls/java/)

### Client Node.js Examples
- [Phone Calls: Migrate and perform expressive queries using Client Node.js](phone_calls/nodejs/)

### Client Python Examples
- [Tube Network: Migrate and perform analytical queries on the London tube network](tube_network/)
- [Phone Calls: Migrate and perform expressive queries using Client Python](phone_calls/python/)

## Explore BioGrakn
[BioGrakn](https://github.com/graknlabs/biograkn) is a collection of knowledge graphs of biomedical data.

BioGrakn provides an intuitive way to query interconnected and heterogeneous biomedical data in one single place. The schema that models the underlying knowledge graph alongside the descriptive query language, Graql, makes writing complex queries an extremely straightforward and intuitive process. Furthermore, the automated reasoning capability of Grakn, allows BioGrakn to become an intelligent database of biomedical data that infers implicit knowledge based on the explicitly stored data. BioGrakn can understand biological facts, infer based on new findings and enforce research constraints, all at query (run) time.
