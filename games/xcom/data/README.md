# XCOM Dataset

This dataset was compiled using information from the [XCOM Wiki](https://xcom.fandom.com/wiki/XCOM_Wiki).

Every effort has been taken to ensure that the data is accurate, however, I cannot guarantee that this is the case.

## xcom-db.ods

An OpenDocument spreadsheet used to enter the data by hand from the wiki.

## xcom-db.csv

This is **xcom-db.ods** in CSV format.

## *.csv

These are the data files extracted from **xcom-db.csv**. If we were using a SQL database to represent the project, each of these files would roughly correspond to one SQL table. However, this database is optimized for human readability. All of its keys are strings.
